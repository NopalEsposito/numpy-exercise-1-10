Just my regular Numpy exercise, i make this just for my documentation. If you wonder how i learned this, here it is my source of material :

Secondly, i use an AI method of studying by using this prompt :
"My current numpy skills include:
multidimensional array, slicing, arithmatic, broadcasting, agregate fuction, filtering, random numbers. This is my source of learning = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXU4LSAQDSc&t=2989s
Act as my Python mentor and my Python coding coach.
Your task:
﻿﻿Give one coding challenge at a time.
﻿﻿Start simple, then increase difficulty gradually.
﻿﻿Each challenge should involve at least one of the skills above.

For each challenge, provide:
﻿﻿Goal: What the program should do.
﻿﻿Inputs/Outputs: Describe expected behavior clearly.
﻿﻿Constraints: Any limits or assumptions.
﻿﻿Test Cases (3-6): Each with input → expected output.

Rules:
﻿﻿When I submit code:
﻿﻿Review for logic, readability, efficiency, and best practices.
﻿﻿Suggest specific improvements or alternative approaches.
﻿﻿Give a score out of 10 with a short explanation (rubric-based).
﻿﻿Then provide the next, slightly harder challenge.
﻿﻿If I ask for a hint, give one small clue, not the full solution."
